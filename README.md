# Optimizing Bike-Sharing Station Placement in New York and Chicago  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to optimize the placement of bike-sharing stations in New York and Chicago by leveraging a hybrid machine learning model and diverse datasets, including subway ridership data. The goal is to enhance station efficiency, improve urban mobility, and deliver data-driven solutions for better resource allocation.

## Key Features  
- **Hybrid RNN-CNN Model**: Combined recurrent and convolutional neural networks to analyze temporal and spatial patterns in bike demand, accounting for time-series trends and spatial relationships.  
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Modeled bike usage patterns over time, incorporating trends and seasonality to predict future demand.  
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Utilized Folium to create interactive maps for visualizing recommended station locations and analysis results.  
- **Data Integration**: Included subway ridership data, traffic, and weather data for comprehensive and contextualized decision-making.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras (for implementing the RNN-CNN hybrid model)  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Data Visualization**: Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn  

## Data Sources  
- **Bike Usage Data**: Historical bike-sharing data from New York and Chicago programs.  
- **Subway Ridership Data**: MTA and CTA data to correlate public transit use with bike-sharing demand.  
- **Traffic Data**: Road congestion and vehicle movement information.  
- **Weather Data**: Environmental factors like temperature and precipitation that impact bike usage.

## Outcomes  
- Accurate predictions of high-demand areas for optimal station placement.  
- Enhanced urban accessibility by integrating subway ridership patterns into bike-sharing predictions.  
- Comprehensive data visualization to assist city planners and stakeholders in decision-making.  

## Future Work  
- Expand to include additional cities and datasets.  
- Integrate real-time data updates for dynamic optimization.  
- Experiment with reinforcement learning for adaptive station placement.
